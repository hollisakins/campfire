# CAMPFIRE Pipeline Changelog

All notable changes to `campfire-pipeline` are recorded here. The format is
loosely based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/), categorized
by scientific impact:

- **Calibration** — changes that alter pixel/flux values for the same input
  (CRDS context bumps, `jwst` upgrades, calibration defaults, reference data).
  Triggers a **MINOR** version bump.
- **Algorithm** — changes that alter output structure or behavior, not
  necessarily values. Triggers **MINOR** (additive) or **MAJOR** (breaking)
  depending on backwards compatibility.
- **Infrastructure** — no scientific impact (CLI ergonomics, plots, perf,
  internal refactors, tests). Triggers a **PATCH** bump.

Versions are git tags of the form `pipeline-vX.Y.Z` (resolved by
`setuptools-scm`). Install a specific release:

```
pip install "git+https://github.com/hollisakins/campfire.git@pipeline-vX.Y.Z#subdirectory=pipeline"
```

Release procedure: edit the `## Unreleased` section below, then run
`scripts/release-pipeline.sh X.Y.Z` (or the `/pipeline-release` slash command).

## Unreleased

### Infrastructure
- Switched version resolution to `setuptools-scm` with a `pipeline-v*` tag
  prefix, scoping releases to the pipeline subpackage rather than the monorepo
  HEAD. The reduction version embedded in FITS (`CMPFRVER`) is now PEP 440 —
  e.g. `0.4.0` for releases, `0.4.1.dev3+g7f4e2c1.d20260504` for dev builds —
  rather than a raw monorepo git short SHA.
- Added `scripts/release-pipeline.sh` and the `/pipeline-release` Claude Code
  slash command to drive the tag-and-push workflow.

## v0.3.0 — legacy

Initial unified `cfpipe` package version, prior to this changelog format and
prior to setuptools-scm. See `git log -- pipeline/` for the change history up
to this point.
